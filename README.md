#  Networking Labs Summary

This folder contains a series of hands-on labs focused on foundational and intermediate Layer 3 networking concepts. Each lab builds on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity to simulate real-world enterprise routing scenarios.

### Covered Topics:
- Static routing (point-to-point and multi-hop)
- Redundancy and route failure handling
- Dynamic routing with OSPF
- Multi-area OSPF with ABRs and loopback interface advertisements

All labs are built using **VyOS routers in GNS3**, with an emphasis on routing logic, topology design, and layered troubleshooting.

##  Lab Tracker

A growing list of hands-on labs focused on routing, troubleshooting, and infrastructure design. Each project includes documentation, configurations, and network diagrams.

|  Lab |  Focus Area |
|--------|---------------|
| [Lab01 - Static-Two-VyOS](./Lab01-Static-Two-VyOS/README.md) | Static routing between two routers |
| [Lab02 - Static-Multihop](./Lab-02-Staticrouting-Multi-hop-VyOS/README.md) | Static routing across multi-hop routers |
| [Lab03 - Failure-Simulation](./Lab-03-Failure-Simulation/README.md) | Static routing failure + redundancy |
| [Lab04 - Dynamic-Routing-OSPF](./Lab-04-Dynamic-Routing-OSPF/README.md) | Dynamic routing with OSPF |
| [Lab05 - Multi-Area-OSPF-Loopbacks](./Lab-05-Multi-Area-OSPF-Loopbacks/README.md) | Multi-area OSPF with ABRs and loopback advertisements |


ðŸš§ **More labs coming soon** â€” covering BGP, route filtering, GRE tunnels, and hybrid cloud scenarios.

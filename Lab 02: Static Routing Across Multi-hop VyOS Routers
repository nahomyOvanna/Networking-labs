# 🌐 Lab 02: Static Routing Across Multi-hop VyOS Routers

## 🧠 Objective  
Configure static routing across three VyOS routers connected in series (R1 → R3 → R2) to enable communication between R1 and R2 through an intermediate router (R3).  
This lab demonstrates:

- Point-to-point IP addressing
- Static routing logic across multiple hops
- End-to-end and link-by-link connectivity testing

## 🛠️ Lab Topology

📸 _Insert screenshot of full topology here_

- All router-to-router links use `/30` subnets for efficient IP usage
- Interfaces mapped as follows:  
  - R1 eth2 → R3 eth1  
  - R3 eth2 → R2 eth2

---

## 🔧 Lab Steps

### 1️⃣ GNS3 Project Setup

- Created new GNS3 project with 3 VyOS routers
- Each router configured with 4 adapters for future flexibility
- Interfaces connected as:
  - R1 eth2 ↔ R3 eth1
  - R3 eth2 ↔ R2 eth2

💬 Interfaces clearly labeled in GNS3 for accurate mapping and reduced config errors.

### 2️⃣ IP Address Configuration

#### 💻 R1

📸 _Insert screenshot of R1 interface config + `show interfaces`_

💬 R1 has `eth2` configured with `10.0.13.1/30`, link state is up/up.

#### 💻 R3

📸 _Insert screenshot of R3 `show interfaces` output_

💬 R3:
- `eth1` → `10.0.13.2/30`
- `eth2` → `10.0.23.1/30`
Both interfaces are up and connected to their neighbors.

#### 💻 R2

📸 _Insert screenshot of R2 interface config + `show interfaces`_

💬 R2 has `eth2` configured with `10.0.23.2/30`, link state is up/up.

### 3️⃣ Verifying Direct Connectivity

#### 💻 R1 → R3

📸 _Insert screenshot of R1 ping to R3_

💬 Ping from R1 (`10.0.13.1`) to R3 (`10.0.13.2`) confirms first link is operational.

#### 💻 R3 → R1 & R2

📸 _Insert screenshot of R3 pings to R1 and R2_

💬 R3 successfully pings both R1 and R2, confirming bidirectional reachability.

#### 💻 R2 → R3

📸 _Insert screenshot of R2 ping to R3_

💬 Ping to `10.0.23.1` confirms second point-to-point link is functional.

### 4️⃣ Static Route Configuration
